# Metalcore Piano Lab

English | `README_zh.md`

A research‑oriented web rhythm game prototype that explores automatic chart generation from audio for metalcore/prog‑core music. The system focuses on onset detection, tempo estimation, adaptive sectioning, and perceptual alignment to build playable piano‑style charts with multi‑lane difficulty settings.

> This project is a lightweight, browser‑native prototype for studying rhythm perception, chart consistency across repeated sections, and player feedback alignment.

## Features

- Automatic chart generation from uploaded audio
- Beat tracking and time‑signature estimation
- Adaptive sectioning with template alignment
- Multi‑lane (4/6/8 keys) and multi‑difficulty modes
- Real‑time feedback with configurable SFX
- Minimal dark UI with custom background logo

## Usage

1. Open `index.html`
2. Upload a local audio file (mp3/wav/m4a)
3. Click “Analyze” to generate the chart
4. Play with D/F/J/K (or 6/8‑key layouts)

## Limitations

- Browser‑native prototype (no deep stem separation)
- Complex polymeter or abrupt tempo changes may reduce accuracy
